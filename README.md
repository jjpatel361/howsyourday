HowsYourDay
=================================
Never miss your memories. Save your stories and experiences (_good or bad_) just by making a phone call.

# How it works
Register using your name, email and save the time you are free at the end of the day. You'll get a message something like this

```
Hey Dave,
How was your day? Call +1917746XXXX to save your experience of the day.
```
You call the number when free and voice log your experience of the day.
Don't worry about the logs, every time you hang up your voice file is saved for you.



## Under the hood

Twilio Voice Recording / Messaging API running on Node JS SDK. The backend is AWS MySQL RDS.
